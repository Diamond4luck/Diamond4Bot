hurried to the toilet because I need to poop, but it turns out the nearest toilet was in repairs, and the furtherest toilet is about 1 km away, for me. So, I found myself an alternative, that made people laugh at me, which is pooping at my pants. 
accidently murdered a man. I quickly threw the body into the rubbish bin, and cleaned up the blood. I hid when there is a garbage truck nearby. When they are about to grab the rubbish bin, they accidently knocked it over and out came the body. Now as far as I know, an investigation is carrying out right now. Shit.
used Discord, and found out the most horrifying thing ever. I got 99+ tags.
played chess with someone and when I captured one of his pieces, he got triggered so hard I laughed xD
played a MOBA game with 3 friends, and we decided to troll, so we purposely afk and he got triggered so much he afk too xD
got into a car accident. Bad news, both of my legs' bones are broken. Good news, I can stay at home until the bones heal xD
did some drugs. A friend told me to buy them to relieve stress, and with curiosity I bought one. That first try was my unlucky try. A police found us and caught us. I was sent to prison for a month. And after I was released I immediately blogged this and wrote it in my diary.
did nothing.
was sad that one of my family members died. I cried the whole time as I missed them so much.
did some coding on my bot. It was hard, but really good once I've finished one and its way better than using stress relievers.
KNOW THAT YOU ARE READING MY GODDAMMIT DIARY YOU ************ I GOT A CCTV SOMEWHERE SO PUT IT BACK AND DON'T READ MA DIARY ANYMORE YOU ***************
am currently survivng a war. We are now trapped underground, with unlimited water but kind of limited rations, as our little underground farms had yet to be expanded. I was sleeping soundly when my mom woke me up, and told me a war had happened. I knew what we're supposed to do; go to our family underground radioactive-protected bunker. This is the fifth day since it happened, and it wasn't stopping so far...
released a lot of "atomic bombs" in front of class... yeah I regretted eating a lot of potato chips.
tried to draw myself. It went wrong somehow and ended up drawing an alien version of myself.
